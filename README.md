**Project Title:**

Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

**Project Description:**

This project uses machine learning to develop a predictive system for early breast cancer detection. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify mammogram images into normal, benign, or malignant categories. The CNN was trained on a dataset of 322 mammogram images, annotated by expert radiologists. The model was optimized using the Adam optimizer and trained for 40 epochs with a batch size of 128. The resulting predictive system achieved a high degree of accuracy (99.97%).

**Project Goals:**

Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify mammogram images into normal, benign, or malignant categories.
Evaluate the performance of the model on a held-out dataset.
Deploy the model as a web application that can be used by radiologists to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
Project Methodology:

**The project methodology consists of the following steps:**

1. Data collection and preprocessing.
2. Model development and training.
3. Model evaluation.
4. Model deployment.
5. Project Results:

The results of the project showed that the machine learning model was able to accurately classify mammogram images with a high degree of accuracy (99.97%). The model was also able to identify subtle differences between normal, benign, and malignant mammogram images.

**Project Conclusion:**

The results of this project demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in improving the accuracy and efficiency of mammogram image classification for early breast cancer detection. With further research and development, these models could revolutionize the field of breast cancer screening and diagnosis, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.
